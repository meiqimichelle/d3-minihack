      <p class="page-content-p">As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres offshore, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI or Interior) has the resources to help the country produce more conventional energy at home.</p>

      <p>Fossil fuels continue to be a major component of our Nation’s energy portfolio. The United States
spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year to buy oil to power our country.19 Dependence on foreign oil is a concern for our national security, our environment and our economy. Even as the Nation responded to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, total U.S. crude oil production was higher in 2010 than in any year since 2003. U.S. natural gas production is also increasing; withdrawals totaled 29.7 tcf (trillion cubic feet) in FY 2012, surpassing FY 2011 production by 6 percent. These are the highest levels of U.S. production since FY 2001, when withdrawals totaled 24.5 tcf. Overall, oil imports have fallen by 9 percent since 2008, and net imports as a share of total consumption have declined from approximately 60 percent over 2004 - 2008 to approximately 41 percent in 2012.</p>
